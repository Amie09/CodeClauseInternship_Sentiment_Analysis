Task 2: Twitter Sentiment Analysis on ChatGPT

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pcminh0505/chatgpt-twitter

Here we perform sentiment analysis on the dataset that contain information tweet content such as actual text of tweet and metadata which contain the date time and other explanatory details of the tweet. It also includes enough information to perform sentiment analysis scores for each tweet, indicating whether the tweet expressed a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards ChatGPT.

Overall, this dataset would provide valuable insights into how users responded to ChatGPT in its early days, including feedback, opinions, and experiences with the AI model. It could be used to train machine learning models to better understand sentiment analysis, or to identify common themes or issues that users encountered while using ChatGPT.
